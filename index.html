        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Austin, Texas, I found my love for programming right at the start of my college career! I enjoy learning a little more about coding every day, 
          and how I can apply it to my personal life. In addition, I'm a diehard nerd for fantasy stories, Dungeons & Dragons, and survival video games. I'm 
          currently situated in Provo, Utah, finishing my education and improving my own skills.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          The Start up project is a webpage/application of my own design based off of the well-known game of checkers. Currently, this conveys the usage of HTML and CSS to format
          the appearance of the webpage and application, without any of the actual usability of JS yet implemented. Eventually, this will be ported to an application where multiplayer
          and accounts wil be properly supported and available.

        <h2>Simon project</h2>
        <p>
          The Simon project is a professor-led design to understand and implement HTML and CSS into a webpage in the form of the game Simon. This demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS 
          to develop a multi-page webserver which doesn't support any user usability, but may later should I have the time.
